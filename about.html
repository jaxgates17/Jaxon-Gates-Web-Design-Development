                <h3 style="color:black"> Where I've Been</h3>
                <p style="font-size:15px">I was born and raised in St. George, Utah. I grew up becoming greatly involved in all kinds of sports. My favorite being soccer. I enjoy doing outdoor activites such as camping, hiking, or going to the Lake. I'm not a very artsy guy, but I do love listening to music, and designing things on the computer (Drawing on a piece of paper, not good..) I'm the youngest of 3 brothers and 1 sister.</p>

            <h3 style="color:black"> What I'm Doing </h3>
            <p style="font-size:15px">Currently, I am in my first semester of college, and I am attending Dixie State University. I plan to study into Web Design and Development, and well, here will be the list of websites or projects that I have made. I currently have a part-time delivery job as a side thing. </p>

            <h3 style="color:black"> What I Hope To Do</h3>
            <p style="font-size:15px">Although I am still at a beginner level of programming, and not a lot to provide at this moment, I do hope to expand my knowledge, and to continue improving this website little by little, to show any new skills I acquire on the way. I hope to be able to use these designs to help other new people who may be interested in learning too.</p>
